# Basic Blockchain Project

Goal: To create a basic block chain implementation using mostly knowledge i've learned while studying bitcoin and other altcoins.  I am trying not to reference actual code from Bitcoin while creating this so that I can test my skillz ;P

Hopes: I dont know, fun times without a real end.

Possibilities: The new internetz of stuffz with ambiguous smart properites and modular flexibility.

To start:
git clone http://github.com/joshdellay/basicblockchain.git && cd basicblockchain && node index.js
